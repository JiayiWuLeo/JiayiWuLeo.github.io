# üë§ Short Bio
Jiayi Wu is a member of the RoboPI lab, he is a master‚Äôs student in ECE Department of the University of Florida. His research focus is on low-cost 3D reconstruction and depth estimation in scattering medium. He is currently working on wraping up his master thesis project under the supervision of Prof. Islam. The primaly research goal of his thesis is to formulate a fast and robust underwater 3D reconstruction algorithm based on the fusion of SfM algorithm and deep learning. He is also collaboraing with other students across the lab to make it lightweight and deployable on low-power robotic systems. <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=xoZE1GsAAAAJ&hl'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url={{ url | url_encode }}&logo=Google%20Scholar&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a>.

My research interest includes: 
- General Environment Vision: Make computer vision systems more robust to the environment (scattering media, bad weather)
- Low-cost 3D reconstruction and depth estimation in scattering medium
- The application of computer vision in the medical field (including but not limited to medical image processing, pathological image segmentation, image enhancement)
- AI-based Surgical Navigation: Make AI have the ability to generate structured diagnostic reports through medical images, and combine NLP algorithms and computer vision technology to achieve surgical navigation
- Surgical robot: Enable surgical robots to have accurate multi-modal fusion perception ability and precise motion control and can perform precise surgery according to the instructions analyzed by doctors or AI
